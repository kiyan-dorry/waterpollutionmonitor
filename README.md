# Water pollution monitor

## Description
Researchers in Aberystwyth University have an idea to assess and monitor the effects of farm-related pollutants on Welsh water bodies.

The project aims to develop a user-friendly app and server-side data storage with clickable features to display water pollution indicators on a map.
It will be designed for farm managers and other users to make evidence based decisions at both policy making and farm level.
Users will be able to access water pollution information gathered from sensors.

## Data sources
- Large datasets of historical data about different water pollutants.
- Biosensors which will be placed in different rivers and water bodies around farms in Ceredigion.

## Indicative tasks
- Establish a set of requirements for the app/web service, including what information will be gathered and what processing will be done on the data.
- Design app/web service to gather data.
- Design server-side storage and processing facilities.
- Design a graphical user interface (GUI) to implement a clickable map to display data gathered by the app and display updates in real time.
- Develop and test the application.

## Additional tasks
- Use an API that collects the latest data and automatically updates in the app
