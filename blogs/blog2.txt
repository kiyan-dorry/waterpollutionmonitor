I made a user stories document and a use case diagram.
For the user stories I used the MoSCoW model (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), including an acceptance criteria of clickable map functionality, data display, integration with biosensors, user-friendly interface, and accessability.
For the use case diagram, farm managers, researchers and policy makers are the users having access to viewing the map and viewing pollution data.
